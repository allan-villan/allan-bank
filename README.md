# AllanBank
This is a simple banking system project that can be run through the console.
After the user enters the prompted information, it is stored in a sqlite3 database.
The checkings balance can be added to, subtracted from, and retrieved depending on how much "money" the user inputs.
There are extra functionalities that can be explored through main.py as well!

This project was created in hopes to:
 1) Better understand the Python programming language
 2) logging the right amount of information
 3) Practice functional programming and object oriented programming
 4) Practice using best practices included in PEP 8

A UML diagram (titled AllanBank.png) is included to better illustrate the inner workings of AllanBank.
